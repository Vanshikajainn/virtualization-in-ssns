The objective is to develop a virtualization of shared sensor networks focusing on temperature, humidity and air quality
monitoring, my objective is multifaceted. Firstly, I aim to abstract physical sensors into virtualized instances, allowing for
the coexistence of multiple virtual sensor nodes on a shared infrastructure. Dynamic resource allocation algorithms will be
developed to adaptively distribute computational resources based on changing workloads, ensuring optimal utilization. Security
and isolation mechanisms will also be implemented to safeguard sensitive data between virtual sensor nodes.
Additionally , I will focus on scalability and flexibility, enabling seamless scaling and deployment of diverse monitoring
applications on the shared infrastructure.
